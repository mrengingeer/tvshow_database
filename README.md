# tvshow_database
The objective of this lab is to enable you to do database programming from within you programs specifically as it pertains to programs written in Java. 
It is simple to see how databases can be accessed from any programming language. For the sake of this lab, we will be focusing on the Java programming language.

In this lab, you will write a Java program that will allow the users to perform the list of operations that you had conceptualized in Lab 1 and 
operationalized through SQL commands in Lab 4 through a Java program command line.
